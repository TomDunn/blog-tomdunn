I started two homebrews last week - a porter and a gingered ale.

## The Porter
The recipe I used here is almost exactly the same as the Sparrow Hawk Porter recipe found in the [Complete Joy of Home Brewing]. The main differences are that I scaled it down to one gallon and used different hops.

### Hops
The recipe calls for [Northern Brewer] or [Tettnang] hops for boiling and aroma respectively. Fresh hops were only available in 1 oz packets so I would need to buy 1 ounce of Northern Brewer and another of Tettnang. But since I scaled down to a one gallon batch I only needed <= 1 ounce of hops total leaving 1.5 ounces of leftover. I wanted to avoid that much leftover as hops can spoil relatively quickly.  

I decided to use the same hop for boiling and aroma in order to minimize leftovers. What hop to choose though? For whatever I reason I did not choose Norther Brewer, Tettnang or anything directly similar. Instead I chose [Chinook] hops which have spicy, piny aroma. Chinook typically have a higher Alpha acid concentration (12.1%) than Northern Brewer. This means I needed to adjust the amount of Chinook I would use in order to achieve similar bitterness levels I would have gotten from Northern Brewer.

Was the hop swap okay? TBD.

### Data Dump
Keep in mind the quantities/measurements below are for a one gallon batch.

Ingredients:
* 0.9 pounds light/amber liquid malt extract - brand unknown as I bought in bulk
* 0.67 pounds dark malt extract - [CBW Traditional Dark LME]
* 0.20-0.25 pounds black malt
* ~ 0.21 ounce Chinook hops for boiling (bittering)
** Recipe called 13 HBUs which is about 0.21 ounce of hops with 12.1% alpha acid
* ~0.1 ounce Chinook for aroma
* 0.25 tsp [Irish Moss] - helps with beer clarity
* ~ half packet [Safale S-04] yeast
* 1 gallon pure water

Timeline/Process:
1. Brought half gal water to 155&deg;F and steeped black malt in grain bags for 30 minutes
2. Removed grain, brought to boil and added malt extracts + boiling hops
3. Boiled and stirred for 50 minutes (rolling boil important for bittering)
5. Added moss at 50 minutes in, continued boiling
6. Added aroma hops in final minutes
7. Put remaining half gallon of cold water in carboy
8. Funneled/filtered the hot wort into the carboy
9. Aerated vigorously and chilled to 70&deg;F
10. Pitched yeast and attached blow off tube
11. Put carboy in large kettle with cool water and ice packets
12. Allowed to ferment ~ 1 week, replacing ice packets daily in order to maintain optimum temp range
13. Primed and bottled

Measurements:
* O.G. was 1.060 (yes! the O.G. is expected to be between 1.058 and 1.062 for this recipe)
* F.G. was 1.020 or 1.021
* Start date was August 30th 2015
* Bottle date was September 5th 2015

### Result

Still in bottle conditioning - TBD

## The Gingered Ale
I used the leftover Dark LME and Chinook hops but added maybe 2 or 3 ounces of ginger.

Ingredients:
* 1.36 pounds dark malt extract - [CBW Traditional Dark LME]
* Remainder of Chinook hops from above
* 3 or 4 ounces of finely chopped ginger (shredded would be better)
* Remainder of Safale S-04 yeast packet

Measurements:
* O.G. was 1.045

### Result so far
Still fermenting.

## Follow-up on my KÃ¶lsch

I did this one several months ago - April or May I think. It was only last week though that I cracked open the bottles of it I had in the fridge. I had been avoiding them because I was convinced they were shitty because I messed up when brewing it. I let my kettle boil over, used too much yeast and may have let it get too warm. I had a sampling after I bottled - it had interesting and slightly intense off flavors that I did not care for.

After it chilled in the fridge for a few months though, it was not bad at all, I enjoyed it. A pleasant surprise. You do not need to execute your process/recipe perfectly in order to get really good beer! Beer is resilient! In other words - do not worry, relax, have a homebrew.
