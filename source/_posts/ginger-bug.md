I love Ginger Beer. I have read/heard that it is pretty easy to make and that the homemade stuff can be way better than the readily available kind. I decided to give it a try. After reading around, I found that the first step is to make a [ginger bug]. It is not actually a bug - just a fermenting ginger/sugar mixture :)

## Making the Bug
I followed [this recipe][ginger beer recipe]. Here are some tips that I gathered:

* Non-irradiated ginger is recommended - if it is irradiated the bacteria may not be able to thrive on it. Organic ginger is your best bet for this.
* Use non-chlorinated water - chlorine kills microbes. Easiest way is to get bottled water, but there are ways to [de-chlorinate tap water][de-chlorinate water] too.

My result:

## Next
I will keep following the [recipe instructions][ginger beer recipe] by feeding the bug sugar and ginger. Hopefully it will start fermenting after a few days and I can make a post about making something with it. The obvious 'something' is ginger beer, but it seems any sufficiently sugary liquids can be fermented using the bug. [Here][ginger soda] is a recipe for fruit/tea soda.
