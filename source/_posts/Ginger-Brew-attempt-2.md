I decided to do another batch, the last was good but I wanted more spice!

## Modified Recipe

* ~15 tablepoons of shredded ginger (double over the last one)
* 2 cups sugar
* 1 mashed up fresh peach
* couple dashes allspice
* juice of 1 large lemon

## Result

Really spicy, maybe a little too spicy.
