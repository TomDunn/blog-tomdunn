This is my new blog! I intend to have lots of DIY, techie posts here (and maybe the occasional rant)....

The site is generated by [Hexo](http://hexo.io/) and is hosted on Amazon using the [S3 static website](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html) feature. Deployments will likely be handled using [s3cmd](http://s3tools.org/s3cmd).

Here is the [source code](https://github.com/TomDunn/blog-tomdunn).
