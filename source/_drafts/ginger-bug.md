I love Ginger Beer, Ginger Ale is good too but generally not spicy enough for my tastes. I have already brewed a few beers and have already acquired some brewing equipment; there was little-to-no barrier to entry for me on this one.

## Work in Progress
I am still working on this :) come back later

With a ginger bug, you are not limited to just ginger beer. You can add some ginger bug to any sufficiently sugary liquid and have a soda within a few days (fresh summer fruit soda anyone?). In addition to being delicious, these fermented drinks will at least retain the  nutrients of the original ingredients and can potentially enhance them. I recommend you read more about [ginger bug sodas][ginger soda] if you are interested.
