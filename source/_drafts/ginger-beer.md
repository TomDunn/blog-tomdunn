I love Ginger Beer, Ginger Ale is good too but generally not spicy enough for my tastes. I have already brewed a few beers and have already acquired some brewing equipment; there was little-to-no barrier to entry for me on this one.

## Work in Progress
I am still working on this :) come back later
