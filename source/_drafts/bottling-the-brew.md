After a week of extremely slow fermentation, I decided to bottle. Nothing particularly exciting about the bottling process - I made a gravity siphon and transfered the brew into my [Grolsch swing top bottles][swing tops]. I took a sample as well.

## Notes
* Gravity barely changed - O.G. was 1.029 and the reading from the sample was roughly the same
* Taste: gingery and sweet up-front but a weak after taste, not as gingery as I would like

My next brew will use much, much more ginger. I think the addition of some spices would help give the brew a stronger finish.

## Next
Now that it is bottled, just need to wait a while. Hopefully the result will be nice and bubbly.
